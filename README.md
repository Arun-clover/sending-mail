It is a basic Frontend to Backend connection program .
In this expriment I use a node.j and express.js for backend.
Then i use Html ,Css for frontend.
In this mini project I learn to connect the frontend and backend,and by getting user data from frontend reun a node.js file in back end using fetch() API,After getting the data I send the message given by the user .
I know that i use  rejectUnauthorized  in this program which is a draw back because of less security.
I have just started so I am just learning So i will learn how to send mail with out using  rejectUnauthorized in my next project 
Thank you🙏
