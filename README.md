It is a basic Frontend to Backend connection program .
In this expriment I use a node.j and express.js for backend.
Then i use Html ,Css for frontend.
In this mini project I learn to connect the frontend and backend,and by getting user data from frontend reun a node.js file in back end using fetch() API,After getting the data I send the message given by the user .
I know that i use  rejectUnauthorized  in this program which is a draw back because of less security.
I have just started so I am just learning So i will learn how to send mail with out using  rejectUnauthorized in my next project 

@required dependencies: 
    body-parser: "^1.20.3",
    express: "^4.21.2",
    nodemailer: "^6.10.0",
    nodemon: "^3.1.9"

@NOTE you can only see that mail is send in vs code if u want u can change the code to your will
My code is only for learning purpose but this is the basic structure to connect frontend and backend

Thank youüôè
